		<IMG src="rodman.jpg" alt="Rodman gets tackled by teammates" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-right:15px">
		<p style="margin-left:15px;margin-right:20px">Dennis Rodman is a retired professional basketball player who played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks in the NBA. He was nicknamed "The Worm" and was known for his fierce defensive and rebounding abilities. Standing at a height of roughly 6’7, Rodman was a rare player that could be sent in to guard any position. When he wasn’t playing basketball, Rodman consistently made headlines with his unique style, multicolored hair, and general off-the-court antics.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:15px;margin-right:20px">The Worm played at the small forward position in his early years and later became a power forward. He earned NBA All-Defensive First Team honors seven times and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships. Recognized as one of the best rebounders and defenders in NBA history, Rodman was a valuable asset throughout his career despite his lack of scoring. On April 1, 2011, the Pistons retired Rodman's No. 10 jersey. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame later that year.</p>
		
		<h3 id=becomingworm style="margin-left:15px"><i>Becoming <b>'The Worm'</b></i></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px">Dennis Rodman was not always the flamboyant and carefree individual he is known as now. Rodman rarely hesitates to open up about the mental health and drug issues that plagued him during his time in the NBA. In fact, perhaps the biggest turning point in Rodman’s career came after nearly committing suicide in his car. He aborted the suicide attempt after having an epiphany, and decided to “kill” the person he did not want to be rather than take his own life. For Dennis, this meant shedding his shy persona and promising to be unapologetically comfortable in his own skin. In the years that followed, Rodman transformed himself into the rainbow-haired enigma that people imagine when they think of The Worm. Rodman never failed to entertain, often getting in fights with players and officials alike, and even infamously kicking a cameraman during one game. He was known to be one of the best (and sneakiest) floppers in the NBA, and often found ways to get under the opponents skin and throw them off their game. This behavior was not new to the NBA, but Rodman took it to new heights, making him extremely unpopular throughout the league. Despite his unpopularity around the league, Rodman went on to win three more NBA titles with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. He enjoyed a prolific career and is considered by many to be the best rebounder and defender to ever play the game.</p>

		<br><h3 id=why style="margin-left:15px"><i>What Rodman Represents</i></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px">Dennis Rodman is as unique as they come. His drive to win and do his best on the court shined through almost every time he stepped on the court. While in Chicago, Rodman claims he never spoke to Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen off the basketball court. In his mind, he thought the best way for him to win would be to treat the NBA like a job. He ended up winning three championships in a row with Jordan and Pippen, and never wavered when it came to putting in work on the court. When not on the court, Dennis was a rampant partier and was known for his wild side. In my opinion, The Worm is one of the best ever examples of a work hard-play hard mentality. Though many have grown tired of Rodman and his antics, I personally respect his work ethic and have always looked up to The Worm for truly being himself and never worrying about the popular opinion.</p>
